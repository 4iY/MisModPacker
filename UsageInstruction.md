There are two main things this application does: Creating a .pak file and unpacking a .pak file.
# Creating a .pak
1. Put all the files you want to pack up inside the Workspace folder
2. Run PakCreate.bat - the .pak will be inside Build.
# Unpacking a .pak file
1. Put the .pak in PakInput folder
2. Run PakUnpack.bat - files will be put into Workspace.
